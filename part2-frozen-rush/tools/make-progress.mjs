/* THE PROGRESS TRAIL'S FIVE PIECES, from the delivered art to what the page loads.
 *
 * Five stickers arrive as 1240-ish square PNGs with a great deal of transparent margin
 * around each — which matters more here than anywhere else in the game, because these
 * are laid out in a ROW. Untrimmed, every stone would be positioned by the margin of
 * its own canvas rather than by the stone, and a row of them would not sit on a line.
 * So each is trimmed to its own ink first and only then resized.
 *
 * They are trimmed to a COMMON aspect afterwards: the stones are drawn at slightly
 * different sizes within their squares, and a trail whose steps are three pixels apart
 * vertically reads as broken rather than as a path. Each stone is fitted into the same
 * box, centred, with its own proportions kept.
